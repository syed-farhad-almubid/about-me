# About Me

👋 Hello! I'm **Farhad**, an aspiring full stack developer from Assam, India.  
This is my very first project on GitHub — a simple HTML page created to kickstart my coding comeback journey. 💻

## 🚀 What This Project Is
A basic HTML page that introduces who I am and what I’m learning right now.  
It’s part of my daily practice and learn in public effort.

## 💡 What I Used
- HTML5  
- VS Code  
- GitHub

## 📌 Why This Exists
This is not just a file — it’s the **first commit** of my return to web development.  
From this point, I’ll keep pushing new projects and learning step-by-step.
